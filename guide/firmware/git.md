# Git Run-down

I'll try my best to cover what I can regarding git here.

## The difference between GitHub and Git

Git is a version control system.

GitHub is a popular website/service for people to host their code/files. It's a medium by which people can host and share git repositories (generally code) publicly, and work collaboratively on projects.

An analogy I would use to describe the difference is like the difference between video files (ie mp4 files) and YouTube. Video files are independent of YouTube, you can make them and watch them locally/offline, YouTube just happens to be a really popular website that hosts a lot of video files. It makes accessing videos really easy, and adds features on top, e.g. accounts, commenting, likes.

If you need more explanation, there are plenty of videos and articles that cover the difference in depth.
