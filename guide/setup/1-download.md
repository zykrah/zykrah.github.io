# Step 1: Downloading Required Software

This section will mostly be a repeat of the first few sections of Ai03’s/Masterzen's guides, just with updated KiCad and different libraries.

Download [KiCad 6.0.6](https://www.kicad.org/download/) (the latest stable version as of writing). The installer file is about 1 GB (make sure you aren’t installing a lite version), and KiCad itself takes about 6 GB of storage.

Also download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). We’ll be using it to set up a git repository which is useful for tracking version history.

**Git is a powerful tool** for software related projects, so learning to use it correctly is definitely something I would advise if you tackle these sorts of projects often.

**Note**: If you want to learn more about Git/GitHub, I recommend the the written guide [by w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp?remote=github).

The following video is also useful:
