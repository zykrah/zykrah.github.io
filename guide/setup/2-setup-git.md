# Step 2: Setting up a Git repo with GitHub Desktop

If you’re familiar with Git/GitHub, feel free to set up a repo however you’d like.
{: .code-example }

Create an account on GitHub if you haven't already.

Now run the installer for GitHub Desktop.

Once GitHub Desktop opens, log in and create a new repository (`File > New repository…`):

Give your repository a name and description (I recommend a name in lowercase separated by dashes). 
For the path, you can choose whatever you like. 
It will create a folder in the path that you choose with your repository name (in this case `C:/Users/.../Keyboards/pcb-guide`).

Once it is set up, publish the repository as below:

If you want, you can untick `Keep this code private`:

If you go to where you created your git repo, you should see the following files:

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Note: if you can’t see the `.git` folder or the extension names (e.g. `.md`), you should check the following boxes in File Explorer:

</div>


If you go to your repo on the GitHub website, it should look something like this:

Feel free to adjust it how you would like, by modifying the `README.md` or otherwise. For the purposes of this guide, I won’t be bothering.
