# Step 3: Setting up KiCad

Run the installer for KiCad and go through the install process.

Make sure these options are enabled when installing:

Now open KiCad. It should look like this:

Save the project file in the repository folder created earlier. Make sure to uncheck `Create a new folder for the project`. Name the project whatever you want, but generally itâ€™s easiest to just name it the same thing as the repository:

Just press `Yes` if you see this pop-up:

Now, you should commit to the git repository. Here's how you commit in GitHub Desktop:
