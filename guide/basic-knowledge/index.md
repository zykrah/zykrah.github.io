# Basic EE Knowledge

**Disclaimer**: This will likely be an entry-level explanation of aspects of EE (Electrical Engineering) and other information relevant to keyboard PCB design. I recommend using other sources (e.g. Googling/YouTube) if you want proper, comprehensive explanations.

Many of the terms used throughout the guide will be explained in this section, so I recommend going over this section and educating yourself to avoid future confusion. 

Feel free to come back to this section if there’s some sort of term or concept you don’t understand in the middle of the guide. I may also miss a few things, so this section is definitely subject to change in the future.

If you're ever unsure of a term/concept, search for it in the search bar above!
