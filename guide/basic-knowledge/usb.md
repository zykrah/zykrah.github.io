# Universal Serial Bus (USB)
There are many varying standards for USB.

## USB2.0
Modern keyboards generally operate at USB 2.0 speeds. 

USB (2.0) connections consist of the following four lines: 
- one for **power** (+/5V/VCC)
- one for **ground** (-/GND)
- a **pair** of [**data lines**](/basic-knowledge/mcus/#data-traces)

Below is the pinout of a USB-A connector:

</div>

## Micro-USB
Smaller USB connectors are preffered for devices such as keyboards or phones. Micro-USB is an example of one that used to be very popular (there is also mini-usb/usb-b).

## Type-C
Many keyboards nowadays opt to use a USB Type-C connector. Type-C connectors have a few extra pins required for hitting USB 3+ speeds that arenâ€™t important for USB 2.0 operation.

These are the pins on a standard Type-C connector required for a USB 2.0 keyboard:

**Type-C connections running on USB 2.0 devices also require 5.1k pullup resistors between the CC pins and ground.** You'll see this in the schematic for the keyboard later in the guide.

Note: There are different types of Type-C connectors (e.g. top mount, mid mount).
