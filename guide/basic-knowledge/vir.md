# The Essentials: Voltage, Current, Resistance

These are the foundations of electronics. Search YouTube/Google if you are unsure of them. 

Having a solid understand of electronics basics sets the **foundation** for what you can learn in terms of PCB design.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
I would recommend **at least** understanding these terms/concepts before continuing:
- Circuits (open vs closed)
- Switches (and what they do as an electrical component in general)
- Voltage (V), Current (I), Resistance (R)
- Ohm's Law (V = IR)
- Resistors
- AC Power vs DC Power
- Electric circuit diagrams
